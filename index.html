		This website is the geoportfolio of Max Carolane. The website entails
		information that is academically and profesionally related to the field of Geospatial Science and Surveying
		<p>
		A brief introduction about myself is that I am both born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and as of March of 2024, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
		Bachelor of Science (Surveying) (Honours) course. My geospatial-related interests is working with remote sensing data, collection and analysis of
		aerial-captured imagery, distribution modelling and creating 3D generations of models using spatial data. My surveying-related interests include working out
		in the field with the different surveying equipment, such as GPS receivers and Total Stations, conducting different surveys and level runs, working through
		the mathmatical computations involved to solve the necessary errors that can be found in the survey results.  My current Geospatial projects involve comparing
		the inequalities of public transport between two Melbourne suburbs through the use of isochrone mapping.
		</p>
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include enjoying playing videogames and collecting Lego pieces.

		Cartography consists of creating maps using spatial data obtained from sources such as publicly online government data and population numbers from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics (ABS). While there were two tests and a first practical (not included as it was more of a report rather than a map), the significant
		practicals completed in Cartography 2 involved the production of three maps of the student's choice based on a specific topic:
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Practical 2: Map directed at a target audience of choice using provided data of Melbourne City</li>
			<li>Practical 3: Thematic mapping of a demographic's population using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</li>
			<li>Final Cartography Map: Free-choice on topic</li>
		</ul> <!--End of bullet points-->
		<p>
			Below are one of the maps that I have created as part of my course:

	<!--SUBJECT 2-->

	<div class="bar"><h2>Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT)</h2></div> <!-- #ID# #SUBJECT# Change the text to fit a subject you have done yourself-->
	<div class="paragraphs">
		Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT) is a unique but very practical and interesting subject done in both geospatial science and surveying. The subject uses 
		knowledge from three different disciplines:
		<ul>
			<li>Surveying</li>
			<li>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</li>
			<li>Cartography</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		For the 2019 version of the course which I completed, the assignment was about the proposal of creating an amphitheatre at Deep Rock Oval located at Yarra Bend Park.
		The main deliverables of the subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Topographic survey map of Deep Rock Oval</li>
			<li>3D generated scene of the proposed amphitheatre</li>
			<li>Amphitheatre and Pathway plan of the proposed site</li>
			<li>Final map of the amphitheatre proposal</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The topographic survey map was created using surveying data obtained on the field using a total station at the Deep Rock Oval, Yarra Bend Park.
			The topographic map was made using the LISCAD program's LISCAD.SEE and LISCAD.CAD applications. The 3D generated scene was created using the ArcGIS 
			suite program ArcScene while the raw data was modified in ArcMap. The proposed pathway was created using ArcMap by using the GIS program to generate
			the pathway based on slope angle and the amphitheatre based on z-values. The final map used Adobe Illustrator to create the map along with ArcMap
			for exporting the 2D amphitheathre image and ArcScene for exporting the image of the 3D scene.

		extensively using surveying equipment, such as Total Stations, GNSS/GPS receivers and surveying datasets in order to relay the locational data gathered/found in the
